The aim is to compare variant calling quality for known trios 
(father mother child) from the DDD dataset by counting mendelian errors

The function used is the mendelian plugin for bcftools 
(suggested by Shane McCarthy)

https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/howtos/plugin.mendelian.html 

This takes a vcf and a file or set of trios and outputs counts 

The trio data is on nfs for the project, and a mapping file
links 'ega id' to the 'stable id' shown in the trios data
- this mapping has to be done first. 

Some 'errors' could be de novo mutations ... I'm not sure whether this 
is (or can be) addressed at all by the plugin (TO CHECK)

Steps

1) get the sample list from the vcf (we used ega_id)
2) make a trios file for bcftools for these samples using the mapping and the trios file
3) run the plugin using bcftools +mendelian <vcf>  -T <trios> -c > <output>

It's important to check the input file format, which is non standard,
if that changes the code must change to match.

Input files:
The original trios file has the tab separated format 
decipher_id	proband_stable_id	mother_stable_id	father_stable_id

The original mapping file has tab separated format 
decipher_id	person_stable_id	sanger_id	ega_id	is_proband	gender

Note:
Gender could be used as a sense check on mother and father (hasn't yet)
