The aim is to compare variant calling quality for known trios 
(father mother child) from the DDD dataset by counting mendelian errors

The function used is the mendelian plugin for bcftools 
(suggested by Shane McCarthy)

https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/howtos/plugin.mendelian.html 

This takes a vcf and a file or set of trios and outputs counts 

The trio data is on nfs for the project, and a mapping file
links 'ega id' to the 'stable id' shown in the trios data
- this mapping has to be done first. 

Some 'errors' could be de novo mutations ... I'm not sure whether this 
is (or can be) addressed at all by the plugin (TO CHECK)

Steps

1) get the sample list from the vcf (we used ega_id)
2) make a trios file for these samples using the mapping and the trios file
3) run the plugin using bcftools +mendelian <vcf>  -T <trios> -c > <output>
